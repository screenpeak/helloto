# Getting Started with Next.js and MDX

This is an example blog post written in MDX. MDX allows you to use JSX components directly in your markdown files.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can import and use React components directly in your blog posts.

## Features

- **Rich formatting** with standard Markdown
- **Interactive components** using React
- **Code syntax highlighting**
- **Full TypeScript support**

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```tsx
export function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful tool for technical blogging. It combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.

Happy coding!
