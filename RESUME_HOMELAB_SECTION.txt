Virtualized Homelab Infrastructure                            2024 - Present
Technologies: Proxmox VE, Ubuntu Server, Arch Linux, WireGuard, Pi-hole,
              Unbound, TrueNAS, ZFS

• Designed and deployed virtualized homelab environment using Proxmox VE
  hypervisor managing 5+ VMs for various services (media server, DNS, VPN, NAS)

• Implemented WireGuard VPN server for secure remote access with split-tunneling
  configurations for mobile and desktop clients across multiple tunnel interfaces

• Configured PCI GPU passthrough for hardware-accelerated video transcoding,
  reducing CPU utilization by 85% during media processing using NVENC/NVDEC

• Deployed Pi-hole with Unbound recursive DNS resolver for network-wide ad
  blocking and enhanced privacy with DNSSEC validation, serving 20+ devices

• Administered TrueNAS SCALE with ZFS storage pools for centralized data
  management, implementing NFS/SMB shares accessible across network infrastructure

• Developed comprehensive disaster recovery procedures and automated backup
  strategies for critical system configurations using shell scripting

• Configured advanced firewall rules and network segmentation using iptables
  for secure service isolation


================================================================================
UPDATED TECHNICAL SKILLS TO ADD
================================================================================

Add these to your "Hard Skills" or "Technical Skills" section:

NEW SKILLS:
• Linux System Administration (Ubuntu Server, Arch Linux)
• Virtualization (Proxmox VE)
• VPN Technologies (WireGuard, IPsec)
• DNS Management (Pi-hole, Unbound, DNSSEC)
• Firewall Configuration (iptables, UFW)
• Storage Management (ZFS, NAS, NFS/SMB)
• GPU Passthrough (VFIO, IOMMU)
• Bash Scripting & Automation

KEEP EXISTING SKILLS:
• Active Directory
• Windows Servers
• Network Design
• Switch and Router Configuration
• Network Monitoring (Wireshark, tcpdump)
• IPv4/IPv6 Addressing
• WAN and LAN Configuration
• PowerShell & Python Scripting
• Access Control Lists (ACLs)
• VLAN Configuration
• Database Management (MySQL)
• Network Mapping (Nmap, CDP)
• NIST 800-53


================================================================================
INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS
================================================================================

Use these when discussing your homelab projects:

1. PROBLEM-SOLVING:
   "I troubleshot complex GPU passthrough issues by configuring VFIO bindings
    and IOMMU groups, which taught me persistence in solving low-level
    virtualization challenges."

2. SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION:
   "I implemented a zero-trust network access model using WireGuard VPN with
    split-tunneling, ensuring only necessary services are exposed while
    maintaining security and performance."

3. LEARNING & INITIATIVE:
   "I built this homelab infrastructure in my spare time to gain hands-on
    experience with enterprise technologies that I wouldn't normally encounter
    in a help desk role."

4. TECHNICAL DEPTH:
   "I documented the entire infrastructure setup process in comprehensive
    technical guides, demonstrating my ability to create clear documentation
    for complex systems - you can see them on my blog at helloto.me"

5. QUANTIFIABLE RESULTS:
   "By implementing GPU hardware acceleration, I reduced CPU usage during video
    transcoding from 95% to under 10%, which taught me the importance of
    resource optimization."
