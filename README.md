## **Project Overview**

This project is a personal website built to serve as both a **resume landing page** and a **Markdown-based webpost hub**. It’s designed for simplicity, performance, and a modern, animated presentation.

The site is **hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)** and built with **Next.js**, combining **MDX** (Markdown + JSX) for webposts, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Framer Motion** for smooth animations.
